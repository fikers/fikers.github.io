            <div class="title">SO YOU WANNA BE A BANKER?</div>
                <div class="textcontent">
                    <p>Investment Banking is one of the most coveted career paths out there. Every movie about Wall Street revolves around a hotshot banker who wears crisps suits and makes a lot of money ðŸ’°. Setting aside these cultural depictions, what exactly is an investment bank and whatâ€™s it like to be a banker? If youâ€™ve ever thought, Iâ€™d love to be that hotshot banker, well you need to know what banking is in the first place.<br><br>
                    
                    At a high level, itâ€™s pretty simple: investment banks work with large companies when the companies want to buy another company or borrow large sums of money from â€˜the marketsâ€™. While you and I might go to around the corner to a bank branch where we open a checking account, apply for a credit card, and one day get a mortgage to buy a house, whatâ€™s the equivalent for large corporations? What if Facebook wants to buy WhatsApp, which they did in 2014, for $19 billion dollars? Where do get a $19 billion loan from? 
                    
                    Just like I donâ€™t have $300,000 to go buy a house right now and need a loan, Facebook might need $17 billion dollars on top of the current $2 billion they do have to buy WhatsApp. <br><br>
                    
                    They go to one of the big investment banks like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, etc. and ask them what the acquisition â€“ the act of buying another company â€“ might look like. How long before we make the $19 billion we pay back in profits from the purchase? Should we create more shares of our company and sell those to get the $17 billionâ€¦ or should we borrow $17 billion from investors (i.e. issue bonds)? Which one will be cheaper for us in the long term? How will it impact our companyâ€™s balance sheet? Will our stock go up or downâ€¦ and if we donâ€™t buy it, who else is probably interested ðŸ‘€? <br><br>

                    In the example above, Facebook goes to the investment bank to find out what acquiring WhatsApp might look like. In reality, maybe the bank came up with the idea that Facebook should acquire WhatsApp. In that case, they could go directly to Facebook and pitch them this idea, something that happens a fair amount too. The highest-level people at investment banks â€“ Managing Directors â€“ usually focus on an industry and stay update to date to be able to come up with ideas they can bring up to different CEOâ€™s. Something along the lines of calling up Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, and trying to convince him to buy Beats ðŸŽ§. <br><br>
                    
                    These are the questions an investment bank helps their client answer. Itâ€™s obviously a lot more complicated but conceptually, youâ€™re helping banks buy companies, sell divisions, raise money for new projects, and so on. Since these companies are so big and many are public companies, once the deal has been executed, you will often read about them in the news: "Facebook buys WhatsApp for $19 billion!" If youâ€™re on the team serving this client, you canâ€™t tell anyone since if people knew, they could buy or sell the companyâ€™s stock to benefit from non-public information â€“ insider trading â€“ which is illegal. <br><br>
                    
                    Why is investment banking so coveted? Well, these deals can happen relatively quickly â€“ sometimes a few weeks, sometimes a few months. When Marissa Mayer calls the Managing Director saying she thinks Yahoo should pay $100 million less for Tumblr, the team has to be ready to make any changes to all their analysis on the fly. It can be stressful and requires long hours, but you can also learn a great deal in a short span of time. Plus, you get to see and hear the inner workings of some of the worldâ€™s largest companies before everyone else reads about it in the news. <br><br>
                    
                    However, as exciting as this might sound, many people only go into banking for a few years out of college before transitioning into other, less demanding roles. As an analyst, the entry level role at an investment bank, you could easily be working from 9am to 2am a few nights a week and possibly the weekends ðŸ˜©. Yes, you might have heard that bankers get paid heftily, but you have to decide for yourself if itâ€™s worth it for you. Some people love it and work their way up from analyst to managing director. Others find it soul sucking and realize they want to do something different. <br><br>
                    
                    Likewise, even though it sounds exciting to think youâ€™ll be on the insides of a giant corporation buying another company, the day to day work of making this happen isnâ€™t as glorious. Thereâ€™s a lot of hard work that goes into executing these deals. Namely, you create PowerPoint decks, work heavily in excel, and spend time taking meeting notes. You can learn a lot from doing all this groundwork, but realize that early on, your role is limited to mundane, potentially boring, tasks. Over time, your work shifts from working on decks and excel workbooks to maintaining relationships with CEOs and convincing them to work with you instead of other investment banks . But still, letâ€™s be clear: you wonâ€™t get to call up Mark Zuckerberg and suggest he buy Snapchat for at least 10 years! <br><br>
